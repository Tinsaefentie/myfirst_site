          <h2>Starting My Path in Frontend Development</h2>
          <p>Tech wasn't my first love. I entered this field amidst societal pressures, but I've since found its creative potential. My goal is to build interfaces that are simple, intuitive, and make technology feel invisible.</p>
          <p>Currently, I'm diving into the world of HTML and CSS. I'm not an expert yet, but every line of code I write is a step forward. My focus right now is on learning the fundamentals, experimenting, and figuring out how to craft experiences that reduce friction and empower users.</p>
          <p>Although I'm just beginning, I hope to use this platform to document my learning and connect with others on the same journey. I want to be a part of a community where we help each other grow, even if we're just starting out.</p>
